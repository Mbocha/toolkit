			<p>Electric vehicles are powered with an electric motor which is ‘fueled’ by electricity stored in a battery. Battery electric vehicles use only electricity as their fuel; plug-in hybrid electric use a combination of electricity and fossil fuel.</p>

			<p>Several factors are driving the shift from fossil fuel to electric vehicles: ever-tightening fuel economy standards and caps on greenhouse gas emissions; projected price hikes for petroleum products; countries’ plans to reduce reliance on petroleum for economic and national security reasons; environmental regulations; and decreased purchase price for electric vehicles.</p>

							<p>There are three types of electric vehicles: hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric.</p>

							<p>Hybrid electric vehicles are powered using a combination of an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. This design is more energy efficient, potentially achieving almost twice the fuel economy and substantially reducing emissions. In the figure below, the principal difference between a hybrid and a conventional vehicle is illustrated.</p>
							
							<p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have the added feature that their battery can be recharged by plugging into an electricity source.</p>

							<p>Hybrid electric vehicles are energy efficient for several reasons:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>They recover energy lost when braking; by running the electric motor as a generator, this energy is used to charge the battery.</li>
								<li>The combustion engine is downsized to run at an optimal speed, thereby increasing fuel efficiency.</li>
								<li>The combustion engine turns off when idling and restarts automatically when needed.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Hybrid electric passenger cars have been available in many parts of the world since 1997. Markets for hybrid electric buses and trucks are also growing. See the <a routerLink="/case-studies" class="m-link">FedEx Hybrid Vehicle Strategy</a></p>

							<p>Battery electric vehicles do not have an internal combustion engine. Instead, they use an electric motor and rely solely on electricity to recharge the battery. As battery costs decrease and range increases, battery electric vehicles are becoming a viable alternative.</p>

							<p>New technologies are typically costly but become cheaper with increased uptake. This can be seen with falling costs of electric vehicles and their batteries. Batteries are projected to become even cheaper in future.</p>
							
							<p>Apart from the purchase cost, there is also the cost of fueling a vehicle. Actual operating costs will depend on the local rates for fuel and electricity. In the USA, where fuel is relatively cheap, electric vehicles still cost about 75% less to ‘fuel up’ than the petrol equivalent.</p>
							
							<p>For example, if you drive a battery electric vehicle for 24,000km a year and pay $0.12 per kilowatt hour, you'll spend about $500 per year for the electricity to charge your battery. Assuming fuel costs of $0.94/liter of petrol, an efficient 12 km per liter vehicle will cost you about $1,900 in fuel. In this example, the electric vehicle saves you $1,400 a year in fuel. Some utilities offer lower off-peak/night time rates, further increasing the savings.</p>

							<p>Maintenance is another cost. With literally hundreds of moving parts, an internal combustion engine vehicle requires considerably more maintenance and various petroleum-based liquids: transmission fluid, motor oil, brake fluid and petrol or diesel.</p>

							<p>Electric motors are simpler in both their construction and operation compared to conventional internal combustion engines. With 70% fewer moving parts, battery electric vehicles require less maintenance. There is no internal combustion engine, transmission, ignition, fuel tank, oil filter or muffler. There also won’t be any oil and filter changes.</p>

							<p>Due to a cleaner, more streamlined system under the hood, an electric vehicle can save the average driver at least 35% in annual maintenance costs.</p>

							<p>In an early projection of total cost of ownership, the Electrification Coalition concluded that &ldquo;by 2020, both electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids offer a value proposition for consumers even without tax credits, and falling battery costs make electric vehicles the best value for most drivers.&rdquo;</p>

							<p>Your electricity bill will be higher; however your fossil fuel bill will go away. The U.S. Department of Energy has computed the cost of fueling a vehicle with electricity compared to fueling a similar vehicle with petrol. The department’s findings indicate the energy in a liter of petrol costs about three times as much as the equivalent amount of electricity. Furthermore, the price of fossil fuels has a tendency to vary while the price of electricity remains fairly stable. This makes it easier to budget with an electric vehicle.</p>
							
							<p>In addition, you can now recharge the battery using solar power, removing your fuel cost completely. To calculate the kWh and number of panels you would need to recharge your electric car or motorcycle, and the cost savings from doing so, visit <a class="m-link m--font-boldest" href="http://www.matthewb.id.au/solar/zero-motoring-bills-electric-vehicle-plus-how-many-solar-panels.html" target="_blank">this website</a></p>

							<p>The battery is the priciest component of an electric vehicle, but costs continue to drop as research and production increase. In addition, some vehicle makers plan to lease their batteries, so replacement cost won't be an issue.</p>
							
							<p>As for battery longevity, every manufacturer warranties its battery pack against failure for at least eight years. After ten years in use, battery packs are expected to still have 75% of their original charge. This means the battery packs can be used by utilities or others for renewable energy storage or providing residential power backup systems.</p>

							<img class="float-right img-responsive img-500" alt="Electric Vehicles and Power Plants using Dirty Fuel" src="../../../../assets/cleanFleet/img/ElectricVehiclesPowerPlantsDirtyFuel.jpg"/>
							<p>According to a range of studies doing a ‘well-to-wheels’ analysis, an electric vehicle leads to significantly less pollution than a conventional vehicle with an internal combustion engine. In other words, electric vehicles don’t replace the tailpipe with a smokestack, even if the power plant’s fuel is ‘dirty’.</p>

							<p>According to a 2007 study by the Electric Power Research Institute and Natural Resources Defense Council, electric vehicles will reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions even if the source of electricity is mostly coal. Using the U.S. as an example, 52% of electricity is generated by coal-fired power plants. Even at that high level of coal usage, pure electric vehicles still reduce emissions of greenhouse gas and most other pollutants compared with conventional petrol or hybrid vehicles.</p>

							<p>The emission reduction from electric vehicles compared to internal combustion vehicles is significant: an estimated 29% less emissions for hybrid electric; 49% less for a plug-in hybrid; and at least 55% fewer emissions for a full battery electric vehicle. When only looking at the street level in a city (where most of the air pollution concentrates and impacts on health), then a battery electric vehicle is 100% cleaner than the alternatives.</p>

							<p>When the electric vehicle is charged with power from a renewable resource (e.g. from wind, solar, hydro etc), the emission relief approaches 100%. As more countries continue the current trend of increasing their investment in renewable sources of energy, the benefits of battery electric vehicles will increase.</p>

							<p>Electric vehicles are also inherently more efficient than their petrol-using equivalents. A typical petrol-fueled vehicle that gets 10km/L will use the equivalent of 16,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually when it drives 19,000km a year. The average battery electric vehicle will use 3,869 kWh for the same distance while a plug-in hybrid will use 4,271 kWh.</p>

							<p>The most convenient place and time to charge is at home while you sleep. Using a 220-volt outlet and charging station, a plug-in hybrid recharges from empty to 100% in about 100 minutes, and a battery electric in six to eight hours. A regular 110-volt outlet will mean longer charging times. Most of the time, the battery will not be completely empty, thus reducing charging time. Fast-charging stations can recharge a vehicle to 80% of battery capacity in less than 30 minutes.</p>
